## Variables
   * A variable is a character string to which we assign a value. The value assigned could be a number, text, filename, device, or any other type of data.
   
### Variable Types
    * Local Variables - A local variable is a variable that is present within the current instance of the shell.
    It is not available to programs that are started by the shell. They are set at the command prompt.

    * Environment Variables - Environment variables store data that's used by the operating system and other programs.
    For example, the PATH environment variable stores a list of directories where the operating system looks for executable files.
    By modifying the value of the PATH variable, you can specify additional directories to be searched for executable programs.

    * Shell Variables - A shell variable is a special variable that is set by the shell and is required by the shell in order to function correctly.
    Some of these variables are environment variables whereas others are local variables.
