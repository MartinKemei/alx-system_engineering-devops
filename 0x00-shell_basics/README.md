## What is "The Shell"?
- Put simply it is a program that takes commands from the keyboard as input
 and gives them to the Operating System to perform.

## Navigation
- With these commands `pwd` `cd` && `ls` you can easily maneuver your way
around the _**LINUX**_ system. 

## Manipulating Files
- The most frequently used commands include `cp` `mv` `rm` && `mkdir` couple 
these with a bunch _flags_ and you will be able to execute pretty 
powerful tasks from the *CLI*.

## Working with Commands

### Commands can be one of 4 different kinds:
1. An executable program like all files usually located in /usr/bin. Within this category, 
programs can be compiled binaries such as programs written in C and C++, or programs written 
in scripting languages such as the shell, Perl, Python, Ruby, etc.
2. A command built into the shell itself. bash provides a number of commands internally called _shell builtins_. 
The `cd` command, for example, is a _shell builtin_.
3. A shell function. These are miniature shell scripts incorporated into the environment. 
4. An `alias`. Commands that we can define ourselves, built from other commands.
